String response = webClient.post()
```

### 🔹 `webClient.post()`

* Initiates a **POST** request (as opposed to GET, PUT, DELETE).
* You’re likely sending a message to an AI model (e.g., Gemini) to get a generated response.

---

```java
.uri(geminiApiUrl + geminiApiKey)
```

### 🔹 `.uri(...)`

* Specifies the **URL** to which the POST request is made.
* It concatenates `geminiApiUrl` and `geminiApiKey`. This is a bit concerning 👇

> ⚠️ **Red flag**: API keys should **not be passed in the URI** unless the API specifically requires it that way.
> Most APIs expect:

```http
Authorization: Bearer <API_KEY>
```

or as a header or query parameter.

✅ Better alternative:

```java
.uri(geminiApiUrl)
.header("Authorization", "Bearer " + geminiApiKey)
```

---

```java
.header("Content-Type", "application/json")
```

### 🔹 `.header(...)`

* Sets the HTTP header `"Content-Type"` to `"application/json"`.
* This tells the Gemini server: **"I'm sending JSON data."**

---

```java
.bodyValue(requestBody)
```

### 🔹 `.bodyValue(...)`

* Injects the request body (your `Map<String, Object> requestBody`) into the HTTP request.
* WebClient automatically converts it into **JSON** because the content type is `application/json`.

---

```java
.retrieve()
```

### 🔹 `.retrieve()`

* Triggers the actual HTTP request to the server.
* Prepares to **retrieve the response**.
* Behind the scenes, it gets the **ClientResponse** and lets you extract the body.

---

```java
.bodyToMono(String.class)
```

### 🔹 `.bodyToMono(String.class)`

* Converts the response body into a `Mono<String>`.
* A `Mono<T>` represents an **asynchronous (non-blocking)** result that emits at most one value.

---

```java
.block();
```

### 🔹 `.block()`

* **Blocks the thread** until the Mono emits its result — essentially makes it **synchronous**.
* This is fine in simple or demo code, but in real production apps:

  * Avoid `.block()` in **reactive pipelines**.
  * Instead, use `.subscribe()` or chain with other reactive operators.

---

### ✅ Final Result

```java
String response = ...
```

* The actual **response from the Gemini model**, in raw JSON (most likely), is stored in the `response` string.
* You’ll need to parse this JSON to extract the model's answer.

| `webClient.post()`            | Starts a POST request                  |
| `.uri(...)`                   | Sets the URL to send the request       |
| `.header("Content-Type",...)` | Declares you're sending JSON data      |
| `.bodyValue(requestBody)`     | Sends the JSON payload                 |
