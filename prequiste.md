---

## ✅ Spring AI Prerequisites (Without Java/Spring Core)

### 🧠 1. **AI & Machine Learning Basics**
- Understanding of **AI/ML concepts** (no coding needed)
  - What is AI, ML, NLP?
  - What are models, embeddings, vectors?

---

### 💬 2. **LLMs & Prompting Concepts**
- What is a **Large Language Model (LLM)** like GPT, LLaMA, etc.
- Basics of:
  - Prompt Engineering  
  - Few-shot vs Zero-shot  
  - Embeddings & tokenization  

---

### 🔍 3. **Vector Databases**
- What are **vector databases** like:
  - **Pinecone**, **Weaviate**, **Chroma**, **Qdrant**
- Concepts:
  - Dense vectors
  - Cosine similarity
  - Semantic search

---

### ☁️ 4. **OpenAI / Hugging Face / Ollama**
- API knowledge:
  - How to use **OpenAI APIs**
  - Hugging Face Models
  - Ollama (for running LLMs locally)

---

### 🗃️ 5. **Spring Boot with:**
> (Assuming you're already familiar with Spring Boot setup)

- ✅ Spring Web (REST APIs)
- ✅ Spring Data (for DB interaction)
- ✅ Spring Configuration & Profiles

---

### 🔐 6. **API Keys & Securing AI Calls**
- Managing API keys (e.g., OpenAI_KEY)
- Using `.env`, application.yml, or Vault

---

### ⚙️ 7. **Maven/Gradle Dependency Management**
- How to add AI-related libraries like:
  - `spring-ai-openai`
  - `spring-ai-pinecone`
  - `spring-ai-ollama`

---

### ⚡ 8. **JSON & REST APIs**
