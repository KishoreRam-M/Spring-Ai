### Fine-Tuning: Teaching the Model New Tricks

Fine-tuning is the process of taking a pre-trained LLM and continuing its training on a small, high-quality dataset of your own. This permanently changes the model's behavior and knowledge.

#### How it works:

  * You provide a dataset of examples that demonstrate the specific **style, format, or task** you want the model to learn.
  * The model adjusts its internal parameters to better match the patterns in your data.
  * The result is a new, specialized version of the original model.

#### When to use fine-tuning:

  * **To adopt a specific tone or voice:** For a customer support chatbot that needs to sound empathetic and on-brand.
  * **To enforce a specific output format:** To ensure a summarization tool always returns a JSON object with specific keys, for example.
  * **To improve performance on a niche task:** When a general model struggles with industry-specific jargon, such as in legal or medical contexts.

#### Practical Example: Answering Company-Specific Questions

Let's say you want a chatbot that can answer questions about your company's internal policies. You have a few dozen examples of questions and answers.

  * **Data:** A JSONL file (`my_qa_dataset.jsonl`) with your examples.
    ```json
    {"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "When is the next company holiday?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The next company holiday is on December 25th for Christmas."}]}
    {"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What's the policy on remote work?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Employees are permitted to work remotely up to two days per week with manager approval."}]}
    ```
  * **How to apply it (with OpenAI):**
    1.  **Upload the file:** Use the OpenAI CLI or API to upload your dataset.
        ```bash
        openai api files.create --file my_qa_dataset.jsonl --purpose fine-tune
        ```
    2.  **Start the fine-tuning job:** Create a new fine-tuning job, specifying the base model and your file ID.
        ```bash
        openai api fine_tunes.create --training_file YOUR_FILE_ID --model gpt-3.5-turbo
        ```
    3.  **Use the new model:** After the job is complete, you'll get a new model ID. You can then use this custom model in your API calls just like any other.

### Embedding: Giving the Model Custom Knowledge

Embedding is the process of converting text (words, sentences, or documents) into a list of numbers, called a **vector**. These vectors capture the semantic meaning of the text. Embeddings are at the core of a technique called **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**.

#### How it works:

  * You use an embedding model to convert your documents (your knowledge base) into vectors.
  * You store these vectors in a specialized database called a **vector database**.
  * When a user asks a question, you convert their question into a vector and search the database for the most semantically similar documents.
  * You then take those retrieved documents and combine them with the user's question to create a **prompt for the LLM**. This gives the LLM the necessary context to answer accurately.

#### When to use embeddings and RAG:

  * **To provide up-to-date or proprietary information:** For a chatbot that needs to reference your company's latest product catalog or internal documents.
  * **When your knowledge base is large and constantly changing:** RAG is more scalable and cost-effective than fine-tuning for this use case.
  * **To ground the model's answers in facts:** It prevents the model from "hallucinating" by forcing it to use information from your provided documents.

#### Practical Example: Searching Through Documents

You want to build a search feature for a large set of technical documentation.

  * **Data:** A collection of text documents (`doc1.txt`, `doc2.txt`, etc.).
  * **How to apply it (conceptual steps):**
    1.  **Generate embeddings:** Use an embedding model (like from OpenAI or Hugging Face) to convert each document into a vector.
    2.  **Store the embeddings:** Save these vectors in a vector database (e.g., Pinecone, ChromaDB, Weaviate).
    3.  **User query:** A user asks, "How do I set up a new project?"
    4.  **Find relevant documents:** Convert the user's query into an embedding vector. Search your vector database for the top 3 documents with the closest vectors.
    5.  **Build the prompt:** Take the user's query and the text from the 3 retrieved documents and send this entire context to an LLM.
    6.  **Get the answer:** The LLM generates an answer based on the provided documents.

#### Code Example (Using OpenAI & a conceptual vector store):

```python
import openai

openai.api_key = "YOUR_API_KEY"

# Step 1: Generate embeddings for a document
# In a real app, you would do this for all your documents
document_text = "The new policy states all employees get 20 days of paid time off per year."
embedding_response = openai.embeddings.create(
    model="text-embedding-3-small",
    input=document_text
)
document_vector = embedding_response.data[0].embedding

# Step 2: Store this vector in your vector database (conceptual)
# vector_db.add_vector(document_vector, document_text)

# Step 3: User query
query_text = "How much paid time off do I get?"
query_embedding_response = openai.embeddings.create(
    model="text-embedding-3-small",
    input=query_text
)
query_vector = query_embedding_response.data[0].embedding

# Step 4: Search your database for the most similar documents (conceptual)
# retrieved_documents = vector_db.search_by_vector(query_vector)

# Step 5: Build the final prompt for the LLM
# This is a simplified example; a real-world app would use multiple retrieved documents
retrieved_context = "The new policy states all employees get 20 days of paid time off per year."
final_prompt = f"Using the following context, answer the user's question: \n\nContext: {retrieved_context}\n\nQuestion: {query_text}"

# Step 6: Get the answer from the LLM
response = openai.chat.completions.create(
    model="gpt-3.5-turbo",
    messages=[
        {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant."},
        {"role": "user", "content": final_prompt}
    ]
)

print(response.choices[0].message.content)
```

### Key Differences Summarized

| Feature | Fine-Tuning | Embeddings (RAG) |
|---|---|---|
| **What it does** | Adjusts the model's internal weights and behavior. | Gives the model external knowledge in the prompt. |
| **Data type** | Labeled training data (examples). | Unstructured documents (text, PDFs, etc.). |
| **When to use** | For specific style, tone, or format. | For up-to-date, private, or vast knowledge bases. |
| **Cost** | More expensive and resource-intensive. | Less expensive, as you only pay for API calls and vector storage. |
| **Complexity** | Involves training, which can be complex. | Simpler to implement in a real-time system. |
| **Result** | A new, customized model. | The same base model, but with more context. |
