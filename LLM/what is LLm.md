# Mastering Large Language Models (LLMs) for Developers

## 1. Introduction: What Are LLMs?

**Large Language Models (LLMs)** are deep learning models trained on massive amounts of text data to understand and generate human-like language. You interact with them via APIs like:

* **OpenAI (ChatGPT / GPT-4)**
* **Google Gemini**
* **Anthropic Claude**
* **Mistral, LLaMA (open-source)**

These are tools for developers to build intelligent apps, not something you need to train from scratch unless you're a researcher.

## 2. Core Concepts to Understand

### 2.1 Prompt Engineering (Your New Skillset)

Crafting precise, clear prompts is key to getting good outputs.

```java
String prompt = "Summarize this legal document in bullet points:";
String inputText = readFile("contract.txt");
String response = aiService.ask(prompt + inputText);
```

* Use instructions like: *"Act as", "Step-by-step", "Explain in simple terms"*.
* Add examples in the prompt when possible (few-shot prompting).

### 2.2 Token Limits

* Each LLM has a token limit (words + punctuation). E.g. GPT-4 = \~8K–32K tokens.
* Tokens = \~0.75 words on average.
* Streaming helps handle large responses by returning them as they’re generated.

### 2.3 API Usage

All major LLM providers offer RESTful APIs:

**OpenAI Example (Java):**

```java
WebClient client = WebClient.create("https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions");

String body = "{\"model\": \"gpt-4\", \"messages\": [{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"Summarize this...\"}]}";

client.post()
      .header("Authorization", "Bearer " + apiKey)
      .bodyValue(body)
      .retrieve()
      .bodyToMono(String.class)
      .subscribe(System.out::println);
```

Use libraries:

* **Spring AI** for Spring Boot
* **LangChain4J**
* **Ollama** for local open-source models

## 3. When to Use: Fine-Tuning vs. Embeddings

| Feature   | Fine-tuning                     | Embeddings                       |
| --------- | ------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Purpose   | Teach the model new behavior    | Add memory/search to context     |
| Cost      | Expensive, time-consuming       | Cheap, fast                      |
| Use Cases | Specific tone, domain expertise | Search, RAG, similarity matching |

Most real apps use **embeddings + prompt templates (RAG)**.

**RAG = Retrieval-Augmented Generation**

* Store data (docs, code, etc.) as vectors (embeddings).
* Retrieve relevant pieces and feed into the prompt.

## 4. Real-World Use Cases

### 4.1 Chatbot

```java
String prompt = "You are a helpful medical assistant. Answer politely:\nUser: " + userMessage;
String reply = aiService.ask(prompt);
```

### 4.2 Document Summarizer

```java
String summaryPrompt = "Summarize the key points from this research paper in 5 bullets:\n" + documentText;
```

### 4.3 Code Generator

```java
String prompt = "Generate a Spring Boot controller for a ToDo app with CRUD endpoints.";
```

### 4.4 Data Analysis

```java
String prompt = "Analyze this CSV and give insights:\n" + csvAsText;
```

## 5. Streaming Responses

For long results (chat, summarization), stream responses token-by-token for better UX.

* Spring AI, LangChain4J, and Ollama support streaming.

---

## 6. LLM Security Best Practices

* **Rate limit** and **throttle** user access.
* **Sanitize input/output** to avoid prompt injection.
* Never send PII or confidential data.
* Log usage & errors safely.
* Use role-based prompts to restrict behavior (e.g., "You are a financial assistant.")

---

## 7. Tools and Frameworks

* **Spring AI** – LLM abstraction in Spring Boot
* **LangChain4J** – Workflow, memory, chains
* **Ollama** – Local model runner (LLaMA, Mistral, etc.)
* **Weaviate / Qdrant / Milvus** – Vector DB for embeddings
* **OpenAI / Gemini / Claude / Cohere APIs**

---

## 8. Final Thoughts


* Learn prompting, APIs, embedding, and streaming.
* Focus on **real-world integration** (chat, search, summarization).
* Start with **OpenAI or Gemini**, then explore **open-source with Ollama**.
* Add LLM projects to your resume to stand out!
