Great! Let’s break down the **workflow of a token** in a typical AI or NLP system like GPT, BERT, or any transformer model.

## 🔄 **Token Workflow in AI (Step-by-Step)**

Here’s a high-level overview of how text is transformed into something an AI model can understand:

---

### ✅ **1. Raw Text Input**
You provide some input like:
> `"I love AI!"`

---

### ✅ **2. Tokenization**
This step **splits** the text into smaller chunks (tokens).

**Result:**
> `["I", " love", " AI", "!"]`

> ✅ The tokenizer breaks the input into manageable pieces (subwords, words, or characters) depending on the model.

---

### ✅ **3. Token to ID Conversion**
Each token is mapped to a **unique number** (token ID) using a **vocabulary dictionary**.

**Example:**
> `["I", " love", " AI", "!"]` → `[27, 1431, 912, 0]`  
*(These numbers vary between models)*

These IDs are what the model actually "reads".

---

### ✅ **4. Embedding Layer**
Each token ID is converted into a **dense vector** (called an **embedding**), which gives the model a mathematical representation of the token.

> `[27, 1431, 912, 0]` →  
> `[[0.12, -0.84, ..., 0.33], [0.41, 0.99, ..., -0.02], ...]`  
*(Each token becomes a vector of 768+ dimensions depending on model)*

---

### ✅ **5. Positional Encoding (in Transformers)**
Since tokens lose their order in vector space, **positional encodings** are added to maintain the **sequence information** (e.g., first word, second word...).

---

### ✅ **6. Passed into Model Layers**
These vectors go through several **transformer layers** (self-attention, feed-forward, etc.) to extract patterns, meanings, and context.

---

### ✅ **7. Output Layer**
After processing, the model may:
- Predict the **next token** (in GPT).
- Classify a sentence (in BERT).
- Translate the text.
- Answer a question.
- Or whatever task it's designed for.

---

### ✅ **8. Token to Text (Optional)**
In generation tasks (like ChatGPT), the model predicts output token IDs.

Those IDs are then **decoded** back to readable text:
> `[27, 1431, 912, 0]` → `"I love AI!"`

---

## 🎯 Visualization Summary:

```
Input Text ➝ Tokenization ➝ Token IDs ➝ Embeddings ➝ Model Layers ➝ Output Token IDs ➝ Final Text
```

---

## 🧠 Bonus Tip:
Different models use different tokenization methods:
- **GPT:** Byte-Pair Encoding (BPE)
- **BERT:** WordPiece
- **T5:** SentencePiece
- **LLMs (newer):** May use custom optimized tokenizers for multilingual/text+code
