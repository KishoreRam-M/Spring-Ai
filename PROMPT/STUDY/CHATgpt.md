Write a comprehensive, beginner-friendly documentation in **GitHub-Flavored Markdown (README.md)** format for **[TOPIC]**. The output should be well-structured, clear, and easy to read. Follow these guidelines:
- Use clear **headings and subheadings** (e.g., `#`, `##`) to organize the content. Prepend each section heading with a relevant **emoji** (for example, 🚀 for "Getting Started", 📚 for "Overview", 🛠️ for "Usage", etc.) to make sections visually distinct.
- Incorporate **bullet points** (`-` or `*`) and **numbered lists** to break down information. Use **tables** to present structured data or comparisons clearly.
- Include **code blocks** (fenced by three backticks) with syntax highlighting to show code examples or command-line usage. Where applicable, provide command-line examples (preceded by `$ ` or `> ` as appropriate) and explain what each command does.
- Encourage use of **diagrams** to illustrate complex ideas. You can include simple ASCII diagrams or Mermaid diagrams (using a fenced code block with the `mermaid` tag) if helpful to visualize workflows or architectures. Keep diagrams simple and labeled.
- Explain concepts in **simple, everyday language**. Avoid technical jargon; if a term is necessary, provide a brief definition or analogy to clarify it.
- Add **real-world examples** or analogies to help readers understand abstract concepts. For example, compare a process to a real-life scenario.
- Provide **resource links** (formatted as clickable markdown links) to official documentation, tutorials, or relevant articles for further reading.
- Format the document like a typical **README.md**, including a concise **introduction/overview** at the top. Include logical sections such as **Installation**, **Usage**, **Examples**, **Configuration**, **Troubleshooting**, etc. Customize section names as relevant to the topic.
- Use GitHub Markdown features such as **task lists** (`- [ ]`), **bold/italic text**, and emojis in list items or headings for emphasis and clarity.
- If applicable, include optional elements like step-by-step **walkthroughs**, **command-line examples**, or pseudo-diagrams (ASCII art) to make the documentation more practical and hands-on.

Ensure the output is formatted entirely in Markdown and ready to be used as a standalone README or documentation page. Do not output any additional commentary outside of the formatted documentation.
